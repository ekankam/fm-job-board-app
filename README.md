# Frontend Mentor - Devjobs web app

![Design preview for the Devjobs web app coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for purchasing this premium Frontend Mentor coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. These premium challenges are perfect portfolio pieces, so please feel free to use what you create in your portfolio to show others.

**To do this challenge, you need a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this jobs board using a local `data.json` to retrieve the data. Your goal is to try to get your project looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data in a local `data.json` file, so use that to populate the content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack application!

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
- Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
